Program:
	
	This program is a console-based input/ouput program. The purpose of it is to take a string that is input by the user and then encrypt the string using the Caesar Cipher shift. The shifted value is also input by the user during the process. This can be done to scramble a string or unscramble the same string or a different one input by the user. It includes a menu that gives the user the option to do the tasks mentioned above alongside restarting or ending the program. 
	
Updates 5/15/2022: Input validation has been implemented to verify input by the user alongside cleaning up various parts of the program by using functions, structures, enum, and more.
