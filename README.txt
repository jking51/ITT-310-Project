Due to time limit on Loom, I had to do it in two separate videos.

Description:
	
	This program is a console-based input/ouput program. The purpose of it is to take a string that is input by the user, or a file that contains a string, and then scramble the string using the Caesar Cipher shift by a key value also input by the user. The user is given a menu using program-ops and switch cases to cycle through encrypt, decrypt, restart, or end the program. Input validation has been implemented at points of user input. This program follows instructions for the assignment to include user and file I/O, secure programming techniques, functions, structures, unions, and good security practices.
