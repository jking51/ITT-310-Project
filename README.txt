Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption

A C program that takes a string and desired key value from the user and allows them to encrypt and/or decrypt the string.

Program:
	
	This program is a console-based input/ouput program. The purpose of it is to take a string that is input by the user and then scramble the string using the Caesar Cipher shift by a key value that is also input by the user. User is given a menu using program-ops and switch cases to cycle through encrypt, decrypt, restart, or end the program. I am in the process of fully implementing input validation for the input from the user. Currently, input validation is working correctly for the key size but is still in progress for the string. I have also introduced new functions for the encrypt and decrypt cases alongside implementing enums and a structure within the program.
